                <p>I've been a dev for about 6 years now and still enjoying every moment of it. I love C# and the .NET ecosystem, but am slowly moving outside the .NET world and into Javascript and NodeJS. </p>

                <p>I got my start in professional programming when I realized I found much of the manual testing I was doing boring and repetitive. Wanting to automate those boring tests and really hone my programming skills, I soon found lots of other opportunity
                    to automate tasks that my cooworkers were performing manually. Working to build tooling to help alleviate the monotony of some tedious, but important tasks in testing allowed me to help a lot of people I worked with in a fairly short
                    amount of time.</p>

                <p>This, coupled with the fact that this aspect of software development allows for a lot of creative freedom has given me great joy when building solutions for others. </p>

                <p>Nowadays, I'm working on projects not confined to software testing. To see the public ones, take a look <a href="/projects.html">here</a>. </p>
